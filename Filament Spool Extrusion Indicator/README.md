# Filament Spool Extrusion Indicator

Prints in three pieces that snap together. The spindle is keyed to prevent the halves of the "spool" from getting misaligned. Features a strand of filament that you can use as an indicator/needle if you are trying to gauge full rotations of the motor. Mine is built with 3 8mm x 3mm magnets. Two almost worked but would slip frequently.

Printing:

* 0.15mm layer height
* 0.4mm nozzle
* 10% infill
* As pictured: Hatchbox black PLA and Prusament galaxy purple PLA

Assembly:

* Take care when removing the filament print from the bed. The little strand of filament breaks off easily.
* Cut the little built in support off the end of the filament strand.
  * I do this with side cutters before removing the print from the build plate.
* Press one magnet into the spindle on the back piece.
  * The back is the one that doesn't have a hole all the way through.
  * The inside of the spindle is recessed by 1mm. Make sure it's all the way in. there should be about 1mm of space left at the top of the spindle. [pictured](images/Magnet%20Position.jpg)
* Snap the front and back on to the filament taking care to alight the key/ridges on the inside of the filament with the slots in the front and back spindles.
  * The front will snap in place more easily than the back due to the magnet preventing the back's spindle from flexing.
* Stack two more magnets on the outside of the back piece (held in place with magnetic attraction) then attach to your stepper motor.

Also makes a great fridge magnet.
