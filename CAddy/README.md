# Super Glue Organizer

![CAddy Front View](images/tray%20front%20-%20full.jpg)

It always seems like the bottle of CA that I have on hand isn't the one I need for what I'm doing. I decided I needed a fun tray for holding my bottles of super glue in different consistencies.

I decided to design it around an ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate molecular diagram. That left me with some extra space so I included additional organizational features.

* A slot in the front size to hold a few popsicle sticks
* The oxygen atom at the 4 position will hold an acupuncture needle (for clearing clogs).
* The other oxygen atom is a hole that can hold a sharpie, a small rolled up rag (pictured), or maybe some rolled up sandpaper.
* The triple bond holds a utility knife.

Bottle holes are ellipses measuring 50mm x 30mm. I designed them specifically with 50g bottles of Hobby King CA in mind.

I included STLs for versions of the tray with and without label text.

## Printing

I printed the knife handle at 0.15mm and the CAddy tray at 0.2mm. The color change is the last 16 layers at that layer height.

No supports are needed and 10% infill is plenty.

## Hardware Required

* 1 utility blade
* 2 hex head machines screws - m3x10 or m3x12

## Assembly

* See the [numbered picture](images/knife%20assembly.jpg) for assembly of the utility knife.
    The knife stores blade down in the CAddy tray. There is a backstop to prevent the blade from hitting bottom.
