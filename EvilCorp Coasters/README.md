# EvilCorp Coaster Collection

I made a collection of coasters of malevolent corporate logos from my favorite shows and movies. Or at least the ones that would work in two colors on a round disc.

Each coaster is 100mm in diameter. Color change is via filament swap. The embossing is 0.6mm so it's 3 layers at 0.2mm or 4 layers at 0.15mm layer heights. That height limits any wobble your drinkware may incur from the non-flat surface.

* 0.2mm layer height
