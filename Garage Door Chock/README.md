# Garage Door Chock

[ [Blog Post](https://dereksrose.com/posts/garage-door-chock/) ]

Our 70 year home's original garage door springs can't hold up our door any longer; and it resists fixes that are anything short of a full cleaning/rebuild. We're planning to renovate the garage in a year so I needed a quick and dirty stopgap solution.

This is a simple ramp-style door stop with magnets in the bottom to hold it in place until friction can take over. Printed in TPU so the garage door wheels will deform it slightly under stress from the door's wheels.

I used TPU that is Shore 40D hardness. I think something a bit softer (but not all the way to Ninjaflex) would have been better. I printed the handle in PETG because it's what I had in the printer at the time.

I made mine with a debossed monogram on the handle. I have also included an STL without it.

## Assembly

I made this using 10mmx2mm magnets because it's what I had on hand. Since I needed a bit more _uumph_ I stacked two magnets into each of the four holes (8 total magnets). With rare earth magnets I always like to use a file to scuff the surfaces of the magnets before I glue them in. I also used thin CA so it's really get into the nooks and crannies.

I also glued the handle to the ramp. I use rubberized superglue here, but I don't really think it was needed. I put the glue on the ramp: some on the bottom of the dovetail and some on the backstop that keeps the handle from sliding out the front side of the ramp. A little glue goes a long way.
