# Ikea Raskog Organization Collection

A collection of organizational accessories for the Ikea Raskog.

There are a variety of accessories including the items in the [Skadis Universal Hook Set](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2853257) (which is not my design). Like that collection this is easy to print (no supports), easy to assemble with no glue, strong, and stable.
